# CakePhp-debug-toggle

Ultra quick hack to Toggle debug messages in cakephp via chrome extention. Can probably be adapted to other browsers easily. 

In chrome go to settings->extentions and drag and drop debug.user.js to enable

Block at the top is just minified jquery so it can added to chrome without any nonsense. 

Requires cake php debug kit to be enabled b/c it appends onto the debug bar. Thus it could quickly be adapted not to require the debug kit.
